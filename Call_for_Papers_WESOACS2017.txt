OVERVIEW

The WESOACS series of workshops addresses challenges that arise from
unique characteristics of service-oriented applications by focusing on
principles, methodologies and tools that support the entire
service-oriented software development and cloud services lifecycle.

Topics of interest include software service development lifecycle
methodologies, service-oriented enterprise architectures, service
engineering for cloud computing environments, models, languages and
methods for service-oriented analysis and design, agile processes, 
microservices, agile processes, microservices, continuous delivery, 
container and cloud technologies, and related topics.

WESOACS 2017 continues a successful series of ICSOC workshops. Over the
past decade, WESOA has demonstrated its relevance by attracting a large
number of contributors and participants from academia as well as
industry, and producing high-quality papers that were published by
Springer LNCS series.

OBJECTIVES

Service-oriented applications play an important role in many areas like
enterprise computing, cloud computing and the web. While there is an
agreement about the main principles for designing and developing such
applications, methodologies and tools that support the development of
service-oriented applications are still a subject of intensive research.

During the recent years, there has been a shift towards the DevOps approach 
to software development, which focuses on a framework where software 
development and operation processes are continuous and inseparable. 
DevOps is a growing trend that prescribes management of development and 
operations activities aiming at faster application delivery with automated 
release and deployment, promoting a culture among the DevOps teams of close 
collaboration and communi-cation without silos and barriers between development 
and operation responsibilities. Agile processes, microservices, continuous 
delivery, container and cloud technologies are only a few of a list of popular 
topics that contribute to the current high performance IT transformation. 
This workshop offers a glimpse at such topics through sessions and keynotes 
that explore research, experience and practice. In this area, close collaboration 
between the research community and industry practitioners is essential to 
develop comprehensive engineering methodologies and tools that support the
entire lifecycle of service-oriented applications and cloud services.

WESOACS complements ICSOC by focusing on core software engineering issues
in the context of service-oriented and cloud service systems, keeping pace 
with emerging application areas of service computing such mobile, social, cloud
computing, smart environments and IoT.
