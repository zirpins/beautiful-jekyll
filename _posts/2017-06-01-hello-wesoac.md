title: "WESOA" becomes "WESOAC"
---

This years' edition of the WESOA workshop series adds a specific focus on recent engineering practices of applications and services for cloud environments that follow so called **DevOps** principles.

This is highlighted by extending the name to **WESOACS**: *The International Workshop on Engineering Service-Oriented Applications and Cloud Services*.

We are very happy to join forces with Andreas S. Andreou and Luciano Baresi to chair the workshop.
